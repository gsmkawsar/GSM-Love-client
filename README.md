* I used MongoDB database my site, MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database program that is used for high volume data storage. It falls under the category of a NoSQL database, meaning that it does not rely on a traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead, it uses a JSON-like document format, which makes it very flexible and scalable for various types of applications.

To achieve this, they implement authentication and authorization mechanisms that rely on the "AuthContext" to make informed decisions about what a user is allowed to access and what actions they are permitted to perform.

* I am using my site React Router a popular routing library for the React JavaScript framework, which is commonly used for building single-page applications (SPAs). It provides a way to manage navigation and routing in a declarative fashion, allowing developers to create complex, multi-view applications with dynamic routing capabilities.
